# student_performances_dashbaord
This Power BI dashboard provides insights into student performance, highlighting top performers and defaulters. It can be used to track progress and identify students who may need timely reminders
Power BI Project Overview (4 Pages Dashboard):

Student-wise Detailed View (Page 1):
The first page provides a detailed view of individual student performance. A slicer is used to select a student's name, and upon selection, all relevant details about that student are displayed.

Batch Summary & Student Status (Page 2):
This page gives a comprehensive summary of the batch. It shows:

Total number of students

Number of dropouts

Number of active students currently pursuing the course

Additionally, a custom calculation has been implemented to evaluate punctuality. If a student's attendance, MCQ scores, lab performance, TD, and TD assessments are all above 70%, they are marked as "On-Time Performers"; otherwise, they are considered "Not On-Time".

Top 5 Performers (Page 3):
This page highlights the top 5 performers using three charts:

Top 5 based on attendance

Top 5 based on final marks

Top 5 based on overall performance (considering on-time submissions and overall consistency)

This analysis helps identify high-performing students in the batch, which can be useful during placement shortlisting.

Defaulters List (Page 4):
The final page displays a list of defaulters â€“ students with pending work or consistently low performance. This section can be used to identify students who require intervention, such as sending warning emails or reminders to complete their work on time.
