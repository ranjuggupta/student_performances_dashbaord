Power BI Dashboard: Student Performance Analysis (4 Pages)

🔍 Overview:
This interactive Power BI dashboard offers a clear picture of student performance, spotlighting top achievers and identifying defaulters. It helps track academic progress and can assist in sending timely reminders to students who need support.

📄 Page 1: Student-Wise Details
A dynamic slicer lets you select any student’s name to instantly view their full performance report — including attendance, test scores, and task completion.

📊 Page 2: Batch Summary & Student Status
This page gives a snapshot of the entire batch:

Total students

Active students

Dropouts

It also features a custom logic to classify students based on their consistency. If their attendance, MCQ, lab work, TD, and assessments are all above 70%, they are labeled as “On-Time Performers.” Others are marked as “Not On-Time.”

🏅 Page 3: Top 5 Performers
Three visualizations display the top 5 students based on:

Attendance

Final marks

Overall performance (including on-time submissions)

These charts help recognize the most consistent and high-performing students.

⚠️ Page 4: Defaulters List
This section flags students with incomplete or delayed work. It can be used to send follow-up reminders or warnings, ensuring they stay on track.



This analysis helps identify high-performing students in the batch, which can be useful during placement shortlisting.

Defaulters List (Page 4):
The final page displays a list of defaulters – students with pending work or consistently low performance. This section can be used to identify students who require intervention, such as sending warning emails or reminders to complete their work on time.
